# Spoiler v1

This directory contains v1 version of spoiler.

To edit contents in spoiler, push to a new page holding another editor instance and returns embed contents to the original page.

This implementation was deprecated because it janks the app even the system on Android, till Flutter 3.32 the issue still exists.
